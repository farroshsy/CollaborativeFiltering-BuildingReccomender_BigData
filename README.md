# CollaborativeFiltering-BuildingRecommender_BigData

This project was completed by Farros Hilmi Syafei (student ID: 5025201012) for the Big Data A class, taught by Abdul Munif, S.Kom., M.Sc.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their similarity to other users. In this project, we will be using a large dataset to train our model and make recommendations based on user behavior.

## Dataset
We will be using the MovieLens dataset, which contains ratings for various movies. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
